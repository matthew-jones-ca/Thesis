**Welcome!** This repository contains the written component, presentation, and code for my thesis, completed in the Wildland Fire Science Laboratory at the University of Western Ontario under the supervision of Douglas Woolford. You can learn more about the lab [here](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/douglas-woolford.html). I completed this project as part of my Honours Specialization in Statistics.

The primary objective of my thesis was to analyze the seasonality and long-term trend of area burned by wildfire in Alberta, Canada, using two smoothing techniques: Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). 

The dataset used for my thesis was sourced from [here](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart). I worked with the National Fire Database fire point data, which included records of wildfires in Canada up to and including 2021. The dataset has since been updated to include wildfires through 2023.
